.. py:class:: CallBack

   Abstract class used for callbacks. A callback is a function that takes in an object and returns some sort of metric. Callbacks are optional input to reconstruction algorithms; the ``run`` method of this class is called after iteration. As such, it may be useful for computing various statistics/metrics as a function of iteration number. For example, a subclass of this class could be used to compute noise-bias curves, provided the ``__init__`` method was redefined to take in some ground truth, and the ``run`` method was redefined to compare the ``obj`` to the ground truth.


   .. py:method:: run(obj)
      :abstractmethod:

      Run method; called during various reconstruction algorithms after each iteration

      :param obj: An object which one can compute various statistics from.
      :type obj: torch.tensor[batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz]
