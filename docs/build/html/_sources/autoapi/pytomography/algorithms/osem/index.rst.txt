======================================

.. py:module:: pytomography.algorithms.osem

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains classes that implement ordered-subset maximum liklihood iterative reconstruction algorithms. Such algorithms compute :math:`f_i^{n,m+1}` from :math:`f_i^{n,m}` where :math:`n` is the index for an iteration, and :math:`m` is the index for a subiteration (i.e. for a given subset). The notation is defined such that given :math:`M` total subsets of equal size, :math:`f_i^{n+1,0} \equiv f_i^{n,M}` (i.e. after completing a subiteration for each subset, we start the next iteration). Any class that inherits from this class must implement the ``forward`` method. ``__init__`` initializes the reconstruction algorithm with the initial object guess :math:`f_i^{0,0}`, forward and back projections used (i.e. networks to compute :math:`\sum_i c_{ij} a_i` and :math:`\sum_j c_{ij} b_j`), and Bayesian Prior function. Once the class is initialized, the number of iterations and subsets are specified at recon time when the ``forward`` method is called.

.. py:class:: OSML(object_initial, forward_projection_net, back_projection_net, prior = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`

   Abstract class for different algorithms. The difference between subclasses of this class is the method by which they include prior information. If no prior function is used, they are all equivalent.

   :param object_initial: represents the initial object guess :math:`f_i^{0,0}` for the algorithm in object space
   :type object_initial: torch.tensor[batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz]
   :param forward_projection_net: the forward projection network used to compute :math:`\sum_{i} c_{ij} a_i` where :math:`a_i` is the object being forward projected.
   :type forward_projection_net: ForwardProjectionNet
   :param back_projection_net: the back projection network used to compute :math:`\sum_{j} c_{ij} b_j` where :math:`b_j` is the image being back projected.
   :type back_projection_net: BackProjectionNet
   :param prior: the Bayesian prior; computes :math:`\beta \frac{\partial V}{\partial f_r}`. If ``None``, then this term is 0. Defaults to None.
   :type prior: Prior, optional

   .. py:method:: get_subset_splits(n_subsets, n_angles)

      Returns a list of arrays; each array contains indices, corresponding to projection numbers, that are used in ordered-subsets. For example, ``get_subsets_splits(2, 6)`` would return ``[[0,2,4],[1,3,5]]``.
