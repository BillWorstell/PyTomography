.. py:class:: CorrectionNet(device = 'cpu')

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`

   Correction net is the parent class for all correction networks used in reconstruction. Subclasses must implement the ``forward`` method.

   :param device: Pytorch device used for computation
   :type device: str

   .. py:method:: initialize_network(object_meta, image_meta)

      Initalizes the correction network using the object/image metadata

      :param object_meta: Object metadata.
      :type object_meta: ObjectMeta
      :param image_meta: Image metadata.
      :type image_meta: ImageMeta


   .. py:method:: forward(x)
      :abstractmethod:

      Abstract method; must be implemented in subclasses to apply a correction to an object/image and return it




.. py:class:: CTCorrectionNet(CT, device = 'cpu')

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.corrections.CorrectionNet`

   Correction network used to correct for attenuation correction in projection operators. In particular, this network is used with other correction networks to model :math:`c` in :math:`\sum_i c_{ij} a_i` (forward projection) and :math:`\sum c_{ij} b_j` (back projection).

   :param CT: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to the attenuation coefficient in :math:`{\text{cm}^{-1}}` at the photon energy corresponding to the particular scan
   :type CT: torch.tensor
   :param device: Pytorch computation device. Defaults to 'cpu'.
   :type device: str, optional

   .. py:method:: forward(object_i, i, norm_constant = None)

      Applies attenuation correction to an object that's being detected on the right of its first axis.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param i: The projection index: used to find the corresponding angle in image space corresponding to ``object_i``. In particular, the x axis of the object is aligned with the detector at angle i.
      :type i: int
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:class:: PSFCorrectionNet(psf_meta, device = 'cpu')

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.corrections.CorrectionNet`

   Correction network used to correct PSF correction in projection operators. In particular, this network is used with other correction networks to model :math:`c` in :math:`\sum_i c_{ij} a_i` (forward projection) and :math:`\sum c_{ij} b_j` (back projection). The smoothing kernel used to apply PSF modeling uses a Gaussian kernel with width :math:`\sigma` dependent on the distance of the point to the detector; that information is specified in the ``PSFMeta`` parameter.

   :param psf_meta: Metadata corresponding to the parameters of PSF blurring
   :type psf_meta: PSFMeta
   :param device: Pytorch device used for computation. Defaults to 'cpu'.
   :type device: str, optional

   .. py:method:: initialize_network(object_meta, image_meta)

      Function used to initalize the correction network using corresponding object and image metadata

      :param object_meta: Object metadata.
      :type object_meta: ObjectMeta
      :param image_meta: Image metadata.
      :type image_meta: ImageMeta


   .. py:method:: get_sigma(radius, dx, shape, collimator_slope, collimator_intercept)

      Uses PSF Meta data information to get blurring :math:`\sigma` as a function of distance from detector. It is assumed that ``sigma=collimator_slope*d + collimator_intercept`` where :math:`d` is the distance from the detector.

      :param radius: The distance from the detector
      :type radius: float
      :param dx: Transaxial plane pixel spacing
      :type dx: float
      :param shape: Tuple containing (Lx, Ly, Lz): dimensions of object space
      :type shape: tuple
      :param collimator_slope: See collimator intercept
      :type collimator_slope: float
      :param collimator_intercept: Collimator slope and collimator intercept are defined such that sigma(d) = collimator_slope*d + collimator_intercept
      :type collimator_intercept: float
      :param where sigma corresponds to sigma of a Gaussian function that characterizes blurring as a function of distance from the detector.:

      :returns: An array of length Lx corresponding to blurring at each point along the 1st axis in object space
      :rtype: array


   .. py:method:: forward(object_i, i, norm_constant = None)

      Applies PSF correction for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along its first axis
                       i (int): The projection index: used to find the corresponding angle in image space corresponding to object i
                       norm_constant (torch.tensor, optional): A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor

      :returns:

                Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to
                            an PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor
