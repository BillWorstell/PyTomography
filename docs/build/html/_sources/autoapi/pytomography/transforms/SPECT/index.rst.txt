.. py:class:: SPECTAttenuationTransform(CT)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of attenuation in SPECT.

   :param CT: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to the attenuation coefficient in :math:`{\text{cm}^{-1}}` at the photon energy corresponding to the particular scan
   :type CT: torch.tensor

   .. py:method:: __call__(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Applies attenuation modeling to an object that's being detected on the right of its first axis.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection induces: used to find the corresponding angles in image space corresponding to ``object_i``. In particular, the x axis (tensor `axis=1`) of the object is aligned with the detector at angle i.
      :type ang_idx: torch.Tensor
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:class:: SPECTPSFTransform(psf_meta)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of PSF blurring in SPECT. The smoothing kernel used to apply PSF modeling uses a Gaussian kernel with width :math:`\sigma` dependent on the distance of the point to the detector; that information is specified in the ``PSFMeta`` parameter.

   :param psf_meta: Metadata corresponding to the parameters of PSF blurring
   :type psf_meta: PSFMeta

   .. py:method:: configure(object_meta, image_meta)

      Function used to initalize the transform using corresponding object and image metadata

      :param object_meta: Object metadata.
      :type object_meta: ObjectMeta
      :param image_meta: Image metadata.
      :type image_meta: ImageMeta


   .. py:method:: compute_kernel_size(radius, axis)

      Function used to compute the kernel size used for PSF blurring. In particular, uses the ``min_sigmas`` attribute of ``PSFMeta`` to determine what the kernel size should be such that the kernel encompasses at least ``min_sigmas`` at all points in the object.

      :returns: The corresponding kernel size used for PSF blurring.
      :rtype: int


   .. py:method:: get_sigma(radius)

      Uses PSF Meta data information to get blurring :math:`\sigma` as a function of distance from detector.

      :param radius: The distance from the detector.
      :type radius: float

      :returns: An array of length Lx corresponding to blurring at each point along the 1st axis in object space
      :rtype: array


   .. py:method:: apply_psf(object, ang_idx)


   .. py:method:: __call__(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Applies PSF modeling for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along its first axis
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param i: The projection index: used to find the corresponding angle in image space corresponding to ``object_i``. In particular, the x axis (tensor `axis=1`) of the object is aligned with the detector at angle i.
      :type i: int
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to n PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:class:: CutOffTransform(image)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   im2im transformation used to set pixel values equal to zero at the first and last few z slices. This is often required when reconstructing DICOM data due to the finite field of view of the projection data, where additional axial slices are included on the top and bottom, with zero measured detection events. This transform is included in the system matrix, to model the sharp cutoff at the finite FOV.

   :param image: Measured image data.
   :type image: torch.tensor

   .. py:method:: __call__(image, norm_constant = None, mode = 'forward_project')

      Applies the transformation.

      :param image: Tensor of size [batch_size, Ltheta, Lr, Lz] which transform is appplied to
      :type image: torch.Tensor
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.Tensor | None, optional
      :param mode: Whether or not this is being used in forward (`'forward_project'`) or backward projection (`'back_project'`). Defaults to 'forward_project'.
      :type mode: str, optional

      :returns: Original image, but with certain z-slices equal to zero.
      :rtype: torch.tensor
